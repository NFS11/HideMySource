# HideMySource
HideMySource is a .exe obfuscator written in C#.

HideMySource was made in C# by me because... I was bored and had nothing better to do. Please keep in mind this is still in development and I can't guarantee it will 100% work.

It uses Resources Protection, Invalid Metadata and Name Protection. It was inspired by ConfuserEx.

Does it work?
- I cannot 100% guarantee it as it is in development. I tried it on a random .exe in my downloads and the program spat out an obfuscated version of it.

Does it work on other kind of files?

- No.

How do I use it?

- Pretty simple! Just open the HideMySource .exe downloaded from Releases and click "Open File" and select the desired application to obfuscate. Then click "Save File" and select where you want your obfuscated .exe to go. Then, last step, click "Obfuscate!" and find your obfuscated .exe in wherever you saved it.

This is still in development and I can't guarantee it will 100% work. Any issues or suggestions, post in Issues! As always, remember to leave a star if you liked it.
